## Inspiration
Managing volunteers and events efficiently is a challenge every community organizer faces. Yet, volunteer work is essential for community support and growth. This is why we created AidAlley.

AidAlley is a volunteer management platform designed to seamlessly connect volunteers with events. Event organizers can easily create events, while volunteers can browse and find opportunities in their area. If a volunteer finds an event they are interested in, they can register and track their participation. Organizers can manage volunteers, log hours, and ensure everyone stays informed and engaged.

> Key features include viewing detailed event information, receiving notifications, and tracking volunteer hours efficiently.

## The Premise
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at [Alx Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/). We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
